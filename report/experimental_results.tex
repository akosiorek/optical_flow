\section{Experimental Results}
Whole lot of evaluation.

\subsection{Ground Truth}
How did we get the ground truth, how was it produced. Highlight pit falls
\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
How did we measure our results

\subsection{Results}
\paragraph{Qualitative:} How does it run, without regards to output quality (simply a measurement of runtimes with parameter fiddling)
Comparision CPU vs GPU etc.

\paragraph{Quantitative:} How does the output compare to ground truth??
