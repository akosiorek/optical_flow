\section{Algorithm}
We might want to do a short summary of the original algorithm to outline how it works, so the following sections make sense.

Gabor filters used to compute optical flow are 3-dimensional, separable, spatio-temporal Gaussian filters. Its response decays fast, but, as it is the case with any Gaussian function, it never reaches zero.
